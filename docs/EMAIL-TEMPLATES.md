## Cold Email Sequences

### Sequence 1: The Google Presence Angle

**Email 1 (Day 0):**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]'s Google presence

Hi [First Name],

I was looking for [their service] in [City] and noticed [Business Name] isn't showing up in the top Google results for "[service] near me" searches.

That's surprising because you've got solid reviews and have been in business for [X] years.

I help [niche] businesses fix exactly this. One of my clients, a [similar niche] in [nearby city], went from page 3 to the Map Pack in 60 days - added $14K/month in new [customers/patients/clients].

Would a quick 15-minute call make sense to see if I can help you get similar results?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. I did a quick audit of your online presence - happy to share what I found, no strings attached.
```

**Email 2 (Day 3):**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Business Name]'s Google presence

Hi [First Name],

Just following up on my note from a few days ago.

I know you're busy running [Business Name], so I'll keep this short:

Your competitors [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] are showing up above you for most local searches. They're probably getting the calls that should be going to you.

If you'd like, I can show you exactly what they're doing differently (and how to beat them) in a quick 15-minute call.

No pitch, just insights you can use whether we work together or not.

Worth a conversation?

[Your name]
```

**Email 3 (Day 7):**
```
Subject: [First Name], one more thought

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this brief since I haven't heard back.

I put together a quick video showing 3 things [Business Name] could do right now to start showing up higher on Google. Took me about 5 minutes to record.

Want me to send it over?

[Your name]
```

**Email 4 (Day 14):**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about helping [Business Name] get more visibility online.

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

I'm going to close out your file, but if things change and you want to explore how to get more [customers/patients/clients] from Google, just reply to this email.

Wishing you all the best with [Business Name].

[Your name]
```

### Sequence 2: The Competitor Intel Angle

**Email 1 (Day 0):**
```
Subject: [Competitor Name] is outranking you - here's why

Hi [First Name],

I was researching [niche] businesses in [City] and noticed something interesting.

[Competitor Name] is dominating the Google results for most of the searches your customers are doing. I dug in to see why.

Turns out they're doing 3 specific things that [Business Name] isn't:

1. [Specific thing - e.g., "They have 127 more Google reviews"]
2. [Specific thing - e.g., "Their website loads 2x faster"]
3. [Specific thing - e.g., "They're running targeted Google Ads"]

The good news? All of this is fixable.

I help [niche] businesses level the playing field. Would it make sense to spend 15 minutes showing you exactly how to catch up to (and pass) [Competitor Name]?

[Your name]
```

**Email 2 (Day 4):**
```
Subject: Re: [Competitor Name] is outranking you

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note about [Competitor Name]'s Google dominance.

Quick question: How much would it be worth to your business if you could capture even 20% of the customers currently going to them?

For most [niche] businesses, that's an extra $[X,000] per month.

Happy to show you the roadmap to get there. 15 minutes, no pressure.

[Your name]
```

### Sequence 3: The Review Problem Angle

**Email 1 (Day 0):**
```
Subject: Your 4.2 stars might be costing you customers

Hi [First Name],

Random observation about [Business Name]:

You have great reviews, but you only have [X] of them. Your competitor [Competitor Name] has [Y] reviews.

Here's why that matters: Google tends to show businesses with more reviews higher in search results. And customers trust businesses with more reviews.

I help [niche] businesses generate 5-10 new reviews per month on autopilot. One of my clients went from 34 reviews to 180 in 6 months - and their phone started ringing a lot more.

Would you like to see how the system works? Takes about 15 minutes to walk through.

[Your name]
```

### Sequence 4: The Website Problem Angle

**Email 1 (Day 0):**
```
Subject: Your website might be turning away customers

Hi [First Name],

I checked out [Business Name]'s website and noticed a few things that might be hurting your conversions:

1. It takes [X] seconds to load (Google recommends under 3 seconds)
2. [Specific issue - e.g., "No clear call-to-action above the fold"]
3. [Specific issue - e.g., "Not mobile-optimized"]

These things might seem small, but studies show that 40% of visitors leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load.

I help [niche] businesses fix these issues and turn more website visitors into actual customers.

Would a 15-minute call to discuss make sense?

[Your name]

## Cold Calling Scripts

### Script 1: Basic Introduction

```
"Hi, is this [First Name]?

Great, [First Name], this is [Your name] from LocalLeap Marketing. I help [niche] businesses get more customers through Google and online marketing.

I'm calling because I noticed [Business Name] isn't showing up in the top Google results for [service] searches in [City], and I thought you might want to know about some quick fixes.

Do you have about 90 seconds for me to explain what I mean?"

[If yes:]
"Perfect. So when someone in [City] searches for '[service] near me,' Google shows about 3 businesses in what's called the Map Pack - that's prime real estate.

Right now, [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] are showing up there instead of you. That means they're probably getting 60-70% of the clicks.

I've helped businesses like yours get into that top 3 position. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call where I show you exactly what's needed?"

[Handle objections, schedule call]
```

### Script 2: The Referral Angle

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your name]. I was recently talking with [Referral name/mutual connection/another business owner in the area], and your name came up.

They mentioned you run [Business Name] and might be looking to get more [customers/patients/clients].

Is that accurate? Are you looking to grow right now?"

[If yes:]
"Great. What I do is help [niche] businesses show up higher on Google and get more leads from online marketing.

Would you be open to a quick conversation to see if I might be able to help [Business Name] the same way I helped [other client]?"
```

---

## Objection Handlers

### "We already have a marketing person/agency"

```
"That's great - it shows you understand the importance of marketing. Out of curiosity, are you seeing the results you expected? Most business owners I talk to say their current setup isn't quite hitting the mark.

If you're happy with your results, I won't take any more of your time. But if there's room for improvement, I might be able to offer a fresh perspective. Would a quick second opinion be helpful?"
```

### "We don't have the budget right now"

```
"I completely understand - budget is always a consideration.

Quick question though: if I could show you a way to bring in an extra [5/10/15] customers per month, which for most [niche] businesses means an extra [$X,000] in revenue, would it be worth a 15-minute conversation to see the math?

What I do typically pays for itself within the first month or two."
```

### "We tried marketing before and it didn't work"

```
"I hear that a lot, actually. Most business owners have been burned by an agency that promised the moon and delivered nothing.

Mind if I ask what you tried and what went wrong?

[Listen]

That makes sense. Here's how I'm different: I focus specifically on [niche] businesses, so I know exactly what works. And I only work with clients where I'm confident I can deliver results.

Would you be open to a quick conversation where I show you what I'd do differently?"
```

### "Send me some information"

```
"Absolutely, I can do that. But honestly, a generic PDF probably won't tell you much about whether I can help [Business Name] specifically.

Would it make more sense for me to put together a quick custom audit of your online presence and walk you through it in a 15-minute call? That way you'll see exactly where the opportunities are for your business.

What day works better for you - [Day 1] or [Day 2]?"
```

### "I'm too busy right now"

```
"I totally get it - running a [niche] business is demanding.

Here's the thing though: the customers who can't find you online are finding your competitors right now. Every day that goes by is more business going to [Competitor name].

I don't need much of your time. Just 15 minutes and I'll show you exactly what's costing you customers. Would [specific day/time] work for a quick call?"
```

### "What makes you different from other agencies?"

```
"Great question. Three things:

First, I specialize in local [niche] businesses - I'm not a generalist trying to work with everyone from e-commerce to enterprise software.

Second, I don't do long-term contracts. You pay month to month, and I earn your business every month. If I'm not delivering, you can leave.

Third, I actually care about your ROI, not just vanity metrics. I'll show you exactly how many leads and customers you're getting, and we'll calculate the actual return on your investment.

Does that sound like the kind of partnership you're looking for?"
```
