## Client Acquisition System

### Month 1-3: Foundation Building

**1. Cold Outreach (Primary) - 60% of clients**

Daily targets:
- 20 personalized cold emails
- 10 LinkedIn connection requests + messages
- 5 cold calls (optional but effective)

Tools needed:
- Apollo.io ($49/month) - Find business emails
- Instantly.ai ($37/month) - Cold email at scale
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($99/month) - Optional but helpful

**Email Template Example:**

```
Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]'s Google presence

Hi [First Name],

I was looking for [service] in [City] and noticed [Business Name]
isn't showing up in the top Google results for "[service] near me" -
even though you've got great reviews.

I help [niche] businesses fix exactly this. One of my clients,
[similar business], went from page 3 to the top 3 results in 60 days
and added $12K/month in new appointments.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if I can help you
get similar results? No pitch, just a quick audit of your current
online presence.

Best,
[Your name]
```

**2. Referrals + Networking - 25% of clients**

- Join 2-3 local BNI or networking groups ($500-1,500/year)
- Partner with complementary businesses (web developers, accountants, business coaches)
- Ask every happy client for 2 referrals

**3. Content Marketing - 15% of clients (long-term)**

- Post on LinkedIn 3-5x/week (marketing tips, case studies, behind-the-scenes)
- Create YouTube videos for local SEO ("5 Marketing Mistakes [City] Restaurants Make")
- Guest on local business podcasts

### Month 4-6: Scale What Works

By now you'll know which channel works best. Double down:
- If cold email works: Increase to 50/day, hire VA to help
- If networking works: Join more groups, host your own events
- If content works: Increase posting frequency, start ads

## Pricing Psychology & Closing Deals

### Discovery Call Framework (30 min)

1. **Warm-up (2 min):** Build rapport, thank them for time
2. **Situation (8 min):** Ask about their business, goals, current marketing
3. **Problem (8 min):** Dig into pain points, what's not working, what it's costing them
4. **Solution (7 min):** Present how you solve their specific problems
5. **Close (5 min):** Present pricing, handle objections, next steps

### Key Questions to Ask:

- "What would it mean for your business if you got 10 more customers a month?"
- "What have you tried before? Why didn't it work?"
- "What's the lifetime value of a typical customer for you?"
- "When you think about where you want to be in 12 months, what does that look like?"
- "What's stopping you from getting there?"

### Handling Common Objections

**"That's too expensive"**
→ "I totally understand. Let me ask - what would 5 new customers a month be worth to you? If a customer is worth $2,000 over their lifetime, that's $10,000/month. You're investing $2,500 to potentially make $10,000. Does that math work for you?"

**"I need to think about it"**
→ "Of course. What specifically do you want to think through? I want to make sure I've answered all your questions." (Then address their real concern)

**"Can you do it cheaper?"**
→ "I could, but I'd have to cut [specific services]. The reason I include everything in this package is because each piece supports the others. Would you like me to show you what a reduced scope would look like?"

## Key Success Metrics to Track

### Weekly:
- Outreach sent (emails, calls, LinkedIn)
- Discovery calls booked
- Proposals sent

### Monthly:
- New clients signed
- Revenue (recurring vs. one-time)
- Client churn
- Profit margin
- Hours worked per client

### Quarterly:
- Average client value
- Client acquisition cost
- Client lifetime value
- Revenue per service line

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Failure Points & Solutions:

**1. Not doing enough outreach**
→ Set non-negotiable daily minimums. 20 emails/day = 400/month = 10-20 calls booked

**2. Underpricing services**
→ Never go below $1,500/month retainer. Cheap clients = worst clients.

**3. Scope creep**
→ Document everything in proposals. Extra work = extra invoice.

**4. Over-promising results**
→ Promise activity, not outcomes. "We'll run X campaigns" not "We'll get you Y customers"

**5. Poor client selection**
→ Fire bad clients fast. One toxic client destroys your capacity and mental health.

**6. Burnout**
→ Cap client load. 15 retainer clients is the max for one person without help.
